# Week 22 - Day 3

#### Django URLs, Models, Views and Templates 

- [**Lecture:** Django URLs, Views & Templates](/second-language/week-22/day-3/lecture-materials/django-urls-views-and-templates/)
- [**Lecture:** Intro to Django Models](/second-language/week-22/day-3/lecture-materials/intro-to-django-models/)

- **Lab:** _The lab for this lesson is repeating everything we just did, except you'll collect something else like Finches and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever._

_The final version of your "Finch Collector" project will be a deliverable._

_Because your completed Finch Collector app will be fairly comprehensive and be a nice addition to your portfolio, you should push it to a repo in your personal GitHub account._
