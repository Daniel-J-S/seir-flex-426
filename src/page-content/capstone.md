# The Capstone Project

The last period of the program is dedicated to your capstone!

During this week, students will be given the opportunity to learn a new skill and/or build upon your existing skills in the form of a capstone project. 

Before you begin, note that this will be your pièce de résistance and your goal will be to make it **AMAAAAZIIIING**.  These will be the projects that you show off to employers, so really throw yourself into it.

That said, you will be given two options in order to pursue your capstone project: 

- **Option A: Build Your Portfolio Website**
- **Option B: Building a new Project using a new tech Stack/technology or deeper discovery of existing skill**

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Option A: Build Your Portfolio Website:

A Portfolio Website is essential to all Developers as it allows us to show off our work. 

Here are some important considerations:

- We suggest creating your site with HTML, CSS, and Javascript **OR** Wordpress (see below)
- No site builder services are permitted. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Bourbon, etc. are okay, but site builders like Hugo, Wix, Weebly, Squarespace etc. are **not** okay. If you aren't sure about it, ask an instructor.


<br>
<br>

## Here are some other attributes of a great porfolio site:

Your site ...

- Is deployed to vercel, netlify, heroku, or github pages or hosted somewhere else
- Contains a list of your current projects (with links to the live sites)
- Contains your resume
- Contains your bio
- Contains a link to your github profile
- Contains a link to your LinkedIn account
- Must be functional for all screen sizes (responsive)

<br>
<br>


**Optional / Your Site Has a Nice Touch**

Here are a list of links to various sites in the tech world that you follow:

- Possible places to find a designer:
    - https://www.freelancer.com/
    - https://www.upwork.com/
    - http://www.guru.com/
    - https://www.behance.net/
    - https://dribbble.com/
    - https://www.fiverr.com/
    - https://99designs.com/
    - http://www.craigslist.org/

- Articles with more freelancer lists
    - http://mashable.com/2010/03/02/finding-designers-online/
    - https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245953



**Optional: Your Site is Linked to a Purchased URL (...possibly yourname.com).**
- See a pretty decent walkthrough of using your domain name [here for github pages](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)
- or for wordpress go [here for wordpress](https://en.support.wordpress.com/move-domain/#transfer-domain-registration-to-another-registrar)

<br>
<br>

**Optional: Your Site is Built Using WordPress**
- It is estsimated that 31% of webpages are built with WordPress. If you think you'd like to work in Wordpress then it is strongly encouraged that you have your porfolio built in Wordpress. [More info on wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)

## Option B: Project Using New Stack/Technology

If you decide not to complete one of the capstone modules on MyGA:

The capstone modules are completely optional if you decide to wait until after graduation to complete them. 

Instead you could build a new project and can use any stack. You have to include at least one new piece of technology such as a new 3rd party API, CSS framework … etc. 

Some students might decide to learn a whole new language like Python of Frontend Framework like Angular or Vue.

It's time to shoot for the stars and build an extraordinary capstone project for this course!

Your capstone project should be an app that

- Has an idea and technical stack (including database and server) that will be approved by the instructional team before you begin
- Is hosted somewhere on the internet

### Option B Technical Requirements
#### &#x1F534;  Mandatory to pass:
##### MVP - minimum viable product

* A **git repository (or repositories) hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* At **least** one Github commit per day
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
* Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in  each of your github repos
* Due to the open-ended nature of this capstone project, each project will have their own additional MVPs that are agreed upon by the instructional team
* Demonstrate that you can **teach yourself something new**, use a technology that you haven't used in class _NOR_ on a previous project

<br>
<br>

#### list of examples:

- 3rd party api
- CSS - Styled Components
- CSS - CSS-grid

- React - integrate Redux
- React - integrate React Router
- React - Typescript
- React UI library: React Materialize, React BootStrap etc.
- React Jest/Enzyme testing library

Module Bundlers:
- Webpack - non-rails app
- Webpacker - for rails app with react
- Gulp

Other Front Ends:
- React Native/Expo
- Vue
- Angular 7

Other Back Ends:
- Python/Django Rest Framework
- Python/Flask
- Ruby/Sinatra

Authorization:
- Authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Other Hosting:
- Host on Digital Ocean
- Host on AWS
- Host on Netlify

- Other Libraries:
- Lodash
- Google Maps
- Moment.js
- jQuery UI
- Chart.js
- D3

Other Databases
- Firebase
- Redis

### Suggested Ways to Get Started


* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

<br>

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

<br>

* Create your **user stories**

<br>

* Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

<br>

* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

<br>

* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

<br>

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

<br>

* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

<br>

* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.


<br>
<br>
<br>


## Presentation

On graduation day, you will provide a **technical demonstration** of your project which:

* Is ~5-10 minutes in length
* Shows off the features of your project
* Be sure to talk about the new thing you taught yourself
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Summary

In closing if you have any questions regarding these options, feel free to reach out to your instructional team for advice. 

Good luck!
